UWA web developement boot camp 2021

## what I managed to do:
first i was given a html and css file.

so i went through looking for better semantics such as section tags,asides,articles and alt tags on all imgs

<br>

gave the nav its own section

<br>
put the main text into article tags

<br>
put the side bar into aside tags

<br>
also changed the footer h2 to h4 to organise better

<br>

## What i did to the css:
now the css was abit all over the place there were many double ups of code and elements and the code wasnt organised very well either<br>
so first i seperate the css into two seperate css files headerFooter and body (which included all links and imgs)
<br>
I then grouped up the headers in the css
